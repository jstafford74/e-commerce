        and edit or remove any Comments from the Site in our sole discretion at
        any time. You may not repost, republish, or redistribute Comments
        outside of the Site. You acknowledge that you are responsible for any
        material you may submit via the Site, including the legality,
        reliability, appropriateness and originality of any such material. You

        (collectively, “Proposals”) other than those we have specifically
        requested. The intent of this policy is to avoid the possibility of
        future misunderstandings when projects developed by Nobafrog’s employees

        that you not send Proposals to anyone at Nobafrog through any
        communication channel. 10. EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS When you make a purchase

        provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such
        communications be in writing. 11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING
        ARBITRATION PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU
        AND NOBAFROG TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE
        MANNER IN WHICH YOU AND NOBAFROG CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER.
        ARBITRATION PRECLUDES YOU AND NOBAFROG FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A
        JURY TRIAL. YOU AND NOBAFROG AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY
        OTHER KIND OF REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. NOBAFROG AND YOU ARE EACH
        WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY. THE PARTIES TO THESE TERMS
        ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE
        FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT
        INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY’S CLAIMS. FOLLOW THE
        INSTRUCTIONS BELOW, IN SECTION (K), IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE
        REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. a. Claims To Which
        This Section Applies. The dispute resolution and binding arbitration
        terms in this section apply to all Claims between you and Nobafrog. A
        “Claim” is any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those
        exceptions listed below) between you and Nobafrog, whether based in
        contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
        theory, that either party wishes to seek legal recourse for and that
        arises from or relates to these Terms or Nobafrog products or services,
        including any privacy or data-security claims or claims related to the
        validity, enforceability, or scope of the arbitration requirement or any
        portion of it. These Terms, however, do not prevent you from bringing a
        Claim to the attention of any government agency. b. Informal Dispute
        Resolution Prior to Arbitration. If you have a Claim against Nobafrog or
        if Nobafrog has a Claim against you, you and Nobafrog will first attempt
        to resolve the Claim informally for faster resolution and to reduce
        costs for both parties. You and Nobafrog will make good-faith effort to
        negotiate the resolution of any Claim for 60 days, or such longer period
        as mutually agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties,
        (“Informal Resolution Period”) from the day either party receives a
        written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “Claimant Notice”)
        in accordance with these Terms. You will send any Claimant Notice to
        Nobafrog by overnight mail addressed to 125 Chubb Avenue, 5 Fl,
        Lyndhurst, New Jersey, 07071, Attn: Legal Department or by email to
        services@sparcgroup.com. Nobafrog will send any Claimant Notice to you
        by overnight mail or email using the contact information you have
        provided to Nobafrog. The Claimant Notice sent by either party must
        include (i) the sender’s name, address, email address, and telephone
        number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; (iii) set forth
        the specific relief sought; and (iv) if an item is at issue, the item(s)
        purchased and date and location of such purchase. The Informal
        Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has received a
        Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it
        chooses to do so. You or Nobafrog can file a Claim in arbitration only
        after the end of the Informal Resolution Period. You or Nobafrog cannot
        proceed to arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution Period.
        If you or Nobafrog file a Claim in court or proceed to arbitration
        without complying with the requirements in this section, including
        waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution Period, the
        other party reserves the right to seek relief from a court to enjoin the
        filing and seek damages from the party that has not followed the
        requirements in this section to reimburse it for any arbitration fees
        and costs already incurred as a foreseeable consequence of that breach.
        The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines for a Claim will
        be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that
        Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution
        process. c. Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions. Except
        for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court (provided
        that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar
        representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related
        to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or
        Nobafrog, including any disputes in which you or Nobafrog seek
        injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
        your or Nobafrog’s intellectual property or other infringement of your
        or Nobafrog’s intellectual property rights (“IP Claims”), all Claims,
        including Claims that are not related to intellectual property or
        intellectual-property rights but are jointly filed with IP Claims, that
        are not resolved in accordance with section(b) will be resolved by a
        neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a
        court by a judge or jury. Such Claims include, without limitation,
        disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of
        this arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability,
        or validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the
        arbitration provision. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant
        any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court. d.
        Binding Individual Arbitration. Subject to the terms of this section,
        Claims may only be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted
        by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), https://adr.org/,
        according to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.,
        (“FAA”). For Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are a “Consumer,” the
        then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are the
        rules applicable to Claims between you and Nobafrog as modified by these
        Terms (the “Rules”). For Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are not a
        Consumer, the then-current version of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration
        Rules and Mediation Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims
        between you and Nobafrog as modified by these Terms. The Rules are
        available at www.adr.org or by calling 1- 800-778-7879. These Terms
        affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this section will
        be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to the extent
        permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the Rules, the
        arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and
        substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy that
        would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine
        the question of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by
        applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable
        remedies that are individual to you or Nobafrog to satisfy one of our
        individual Claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by
        credible relevant evidence). To the extent that you prevail on a Claim
        and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief whose
        primary purpose and effect is to prohibit and enjoin conduct harmful to
        the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must
        be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
        arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public
        injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of
        any individual Claims in arbitration. e. Arbitration Procedure and
        Location. You or Nobafrog may initiate arbitration of any Claim not
        resolved during the Informal Resolution Period and not excluded under
        this section(c) by filing a demand for arbitration with AAA in
        accordance with the Rules. Instructions for filing a demand for with AAA
        are available on the AAA website. You will send a copy of any demand for
        arbitration to Nobafrog by overnight mail addressed to 125 Chubb Avenue,
        5 Fl, Lyndhurst, New Jersey, 07071, Attn: Legal Department or by email
        to services@sparcgroup.com. Nobafrog will send any demand for
        arbitration to you by overnight mail or email using the contact
        information you have provided to Nobafrog. The arbitration will be
        conducted by a single arbitrator in the English language. You and
        Nobafrog both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.
        For Claims in which the claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the
        arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions,
        without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal
        hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000
        or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing
        to be necessary, hearings will be conducted by video or telephone,
        unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary.
        If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States,
        the hearing will take place in New York, New York unless you are a
        Consumer and the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship
        for you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the
        claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the
        United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by
        the applicable Rules. The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve
        all Claims in arbitration. Unless you and Nobafrog agree otherwise, any
        decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision
        of each Claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s
        essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. An arbitration
        award, and any judgment confirming it, apply only to that specific case;
        it cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to
        enforce the award itself unless the parties agree prior to issuance of
        the award. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced as a final
        judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable,
        application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any
        award and an order of enforcement. f. Arbitration Fees. Each party will
        be responsible for arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable
        Rules and these Terms. g. Frivolous or Improper Claims. To the extent
        permitted by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs incurred by
        the responding party, including any attorney fees, related to a Claim if
        an arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the
        Claim was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, such as to
        harass the defending party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly
        increase the cost of dispute resolution. h. Confidentiality. If you or
        Nobafrog serve a Claimant Notice or submit a Claim to arbitration, you
        and Nobafrog agree to cooperate to seek protection (from the arbitrator
        or otherwise) for any confidential, proprietary, trade-secret, or
        otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other
        materials that might be exchanged or the subject of any discovery. You
        and Nobafrog agree to seek such protection before any such information,
        documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the
        subject of discovery. i. One Year to Assert Claims. To the extent
        permitted by law, any Claim by you or Nobafrog against the other must be
        filed within one year after such Claim arises; otherwise, the Claim is
        permanently barred, which means that you or Nobafrog will no longer have
        the right to assert that Claim. j. Mass Arbitrations. If 25 or more
        Claimant Notices are received by a party that raise similar claims and
        have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “Mass
        Arbitrations” and will be treated as mass arbitrations according to the
        AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, if and to the extent Mass
        Arbitrations are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You
        or Nobafrog may advise the other of your or Nobafrog’s belief that
        Claims are Mass Arbitrations, and disputes over whether a Claim meets
        the definition of “Mass Arbitrations” will be decided by the arbitration
        provider as an administrative matter. To the extent either party is
        asserting the same Claim as other persons and are represented by common
        or coordinated counsel, that party waives any objection that the joinder
        of all such persons is impracticable. The following procedures are
        intended to supplement the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules,
        and to the extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede
        them. Mass Arbitrations may only be filed in arbitration as permitted by
        the process set forth below. Applicable statutes of limitations will be
        tolled for Claims asserted in Mass Arbitrations from the time a
        compliant Claimant Notice has been received by a party until these Terms
        permits such Mass Arbitration to be filed in arbitration or court.
        Initial Bellwether: The bellwether process set forth in this section
        will not proceed until counsel representing the Mass Arbitrations has
        advised the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or
        substantially all the Claimant Notices for the Mass Arbitrations have
        been submitted. After that point, counsel for the parties will select 20
        Mass Arbitrations to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow
        each side to test the merits of its arguments. Each side will select 10
        claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose,
        and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider.
        The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Mass Arbitrations will
        be delayed by this bellwether process. Any remaining Mass Arbitrations
        shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any
        arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and
        until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration
        proceedings as set out in this section. A single arbitrator will preside
        over each Mass Arbitration chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only
        one Mass Arbitration may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a
        bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. Each Mass
        Arbitration chosen for a bellwether will otherwise be subject to the
        terms of this section generally applicable to Claims filed in
        arbitration. Mediation: Once the arbitrations that are part of the
        bellwether process have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the
        other party agree), counsel for the parties must engage in a single
        mediation of all remaining Mass Arbitrations, with the mediator’s fee
        paid for by Nobafrog. Counsel for the claimants and the other party must
        agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last
        bellwether arbitration. If counsel for the claimants and the other party
        cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will
        appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. All parties will
        cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as
        quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed. Remaining
        Claims: If the mediation process concludes with 100 or more unresolved
        Mass Arbitrations remaining, any party to a remaining Mass Arbitration
        may elect to no longer have the arbitration requirement in this section
        apply to all remaining Mass Arbitrations for which a compliant Claimant
        Notice was received by the other party but that were not resolved in the
        bellwether process or global mediation. To be effective, such an
        election must be communicated in writing (email suffices) to counsel for
        the opposing party (or to the opposing party if they do not have
        counsel) within 30 days of mediation concluding. Mass Arbitrations
        released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in accordance
        with the Governing Law and Venue section of these Terms. If the
        mediation process concludes with fewer than 100 Mass Arbitrations
        remaining or if no party makes a timely election as provided for in the
        previous paragraph, the AAA will randomly select 50 Mass Arbitrations
        (or the total remaining amount if less than 50) to proceed in
        arbitration as a second batch. The AAA will randomly select eligible
        claimants who have provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose,
        and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider.
        A single arbitrator will preside over each Mass Arbitration chosen for
        this second batch, and only one Mass Arbitration may be assigned to each
        arbitrator as part of this second batch unless the parties agree
        otherwise. Once all arbitrations in the foregoing process are complete,
        the parties will repeat this process until all Mass Arbitrations have
        been arbitrated. Each Mass Arbitration chosen for a batch will otherwise
        be subject to the terms of this section generally applicable to Claims
        filed in arbitration. If Mass Arbitrations released from the arbitration
        requirement are brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment,
        but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought
        may comprise only the claimants in Mass Arbitrations for which a
        compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party. Any party may
        contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any
        available basis. A court will have authority to enforce the bellwether
        and mediation processes defined in this section and may enjoin the
        filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with
        it. k. Opting Out of Arbitration. You have the right to opt out of
        binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted these
        Terms by emailing services@sparcgroup.com. To be effective, the opt-out
        notice must be received by us within the 30-day period and must include
        your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also
        clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration to be
        valid. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve
        disputes in accordance with the Governing Law and Venue section of these
        Terms. l. Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any
        change we make to this section (except address changes) by sending us
        notice of your rejection within 30 days of the change via email at
        services@sparcgroup.com. To be effective, your rejection must be
        received by us within the 30-day period and must include your full name,
        mailing address, and email address and clearly indicate your intent to
        reject changes. Changes to this section may only be rejected as a whole,
        and you may not reject only certain changes to this section. If you
        reject changes made to this section, the most recent version of this
        section that you have not rejected will continue to apply. m.
        Severability. If any portion of this section is found to be
        unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to
        because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or
        unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of
        the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever
        on the remainder of this section or the parties’ ability to compel
        arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to
        this section; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore
        proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis,
        such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent
        jurisdiction, in accordance with these Terms, and not in arbitration.
        The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any
        individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this section
        is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive
        relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is
        allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this
        section will be enforceable. 12. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE These Terms and
        any Claim will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
        with the laws of New York, New York, except to the extent preempted by
        U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
        (whether of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
        application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Claim that is not
        subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be
        resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts of New York and the
        United States, respectively, sitting in New York, New York. You and
        Nobafrog waive any objection to venue in any such courts. 13. ERRORS,

        20. MODIFYING THESE TERMS Nobafrog may make changes to these Terms from

        of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice via its
        website, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless Nobafrog
        says otherwise in its notice, the amended Terms will be effective
        immediately. Unless material changes are made to the arbitration
        provision under Section 11, Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration, you
        agree that modification of these Terms does not create a new right to
        opt out of arbitration. 21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY; NO WAIVER
        These Terms, including any applicable policy contained in the Site,
        constitute the entire agreement between you and Nobafrog relating to the
        subject matter addressed herein. If any provision of these Terms shall
        be deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that
        provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not
        affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The
        waiver of any provision of this agreement shall not be considered a
        waiver of any other provision or of Nobafrog’s right to require strict
        observance of each of the terms herein. 22. SURVIVAL The parties’
        respective rights and obligations under Sections 1, 3, 4, 12, 13, 16, 17
        and 18 of these Terms, together with all other provisions that may
        reasonably be construed to survive, will survive the expiration or
        termination of these Terms for any reason. 23. MISCELLANEOUS. The
        failure of Nobafrog to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
        these Terms will not operate as a waiver of that right or provision.
        Except as otherwise stated, if any provision or part of a provision of
        these Terms other than Section 11, Dispute Resolution; Binding
        Arbitration, is found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that
        provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms
        and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
        provisions. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only
        and have no legal or contractual effect. Any references to “including”
        will be deemed to mean “including without limitation.” Except as
        otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the
        benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party
        beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree that
